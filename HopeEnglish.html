						<h4>Project Background : Course Project</h4>
						<h4>Project date : 2018.2 - 2018.6</h4>
						<h4>Project duration : 4 months</h4>
						<h4>Project course : User Experience and Usability Evaluation</h4>
						<h4>Project supervisor : Hope English's CFO, Jasper Chang & Dr. "Stanley" Yung-Ju Chang</h4>
						<h4>A group project</h4>
						<div class="row">

								<h3>What's the issue</h3>
								<p> We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the mobile app of Hope English, the leading brand of English learning in Taiwan. Evaluational methods conducted includes Interaction map, Interviews, Persona & Scenario, Comparative Analysis, Survey, Heuristic Evaluation, and Usability Test.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<h3>What evaluational methods are conducted</h3>
								<p>To understand the app thoroughly and provide insightful suggestion to improve the user experience, we utilized the techniques mentioned below.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<img class="image left-big" src="images/inter2.png" alt=""/>
								<h4>Interaction Map</h4>
								<p>In the Interaction Map, we analyzed the views of the app and the relationship between each view (or activity). This step gave us a comprehensive understanding of our target product.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<img class="image left-big" src="images/Interview.png" alt=""/>
								<h4>Interview, Persona & Scenario</h4>
								<p>In order to determine the target audience of the product, we conducted an interview to understand peoples' incentives and behaviors in online language learning activities. By digging into their scenarios, attitudes, and experiences, we established three main Personas and their corresponding Scenarios of our target audience.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<img class="image left-big" src="images/Survey.png" alt=""/>
								<h4>Survey</h4>
								<p>A Survey was conducted following qualitative analysis to further collect the quantitative data. We collected participants' characteristics, attitudes, and behaviors in online language learning activities. Furthermore, we collect participants' self-report usability evaluation of our target product using the System Usability Scale (SUS).</p>
							</div>
							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<img class="image left-big" src="images/Comparative.png" alt=""/>
								<h4>Comparative Analysis</h4>
								<p>A Comparative Analysis is conducted to better understand how other comparators design their products. We compare our client's design with others' to learn from the good ones and avoid poor design choices.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<img class="image left-big" src="images/Heuristic.png" alt=""/>
								<h4>Heuristic Evaluation</h4>
								<p>A Heuristic Evaluation is conducted by the researchers. Based on the 10 Heuristic principles established by Jakob Nielsen, we set up scenarios, then each of us provided an individual evaluation of the violations of heuristic principles occurs in the scenario. We then generated our findings after debriefing and discussion.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<img class="image left-big" src="images/Usability.png" alt=""/>
								<h4>Usability Test</h4>
								<p>The last evaluation we conducted was a Usability Test. Unlike the Heuristic Evaluation, Usability Test invited the user to participate in our experiment. The participants were asked to perform the tasks planed by the researchers. The researchers evaluated difficulties participants faced when performing tasks. Participants were also asked to fill out questionnaires to provide their perceived experience during the task. We then generated our findings after data analysis and discussion.</p>

								<h3>What I learn from this</h3>
								<p>Due to the Non-Disclosure Agreement I cannot present the detail results here.</p>
								<p>I learned a lot from this experience. The evaluation training I received will definitely serve as my stepping stone to pursue advanced HCI evaluation knowledge. Moreover, this project provided me a chance to develop hands-on experience, work with a field supervisor, and gain capability to address obstacles and challenges arise in real-world projects.</p>
